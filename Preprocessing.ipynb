To reiterate my original explanatoin to James: I'm interested in this more on a meta level (how do we approach controversial subjects) than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards Moore and his film; that is, I'm trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about.  For an encyclopedia based around the concept of a Neutral Point of View, any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is, in itself, an editorial statment seems wrong; such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article.  See, for example, something like Roe v. Wade  there's no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case.  Even if you really consider Moore's movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda (and to risk the Wiki-equivalent of Godwin's Law here), note that the article on Triumph of the Will doesn't feel the need to explain all the reasons why Nazi Germany wasn't all it was cracked up to be.

Through the figure of Christ, Christianity has Judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted; only the ‘weak’ continue to worship a ‘dead Jew’.95 The emphasis on the Judaic roots of Christianity, however, is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals, sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion Mithras, which was introduced into Iran and India by marauding Aryan tribes from the Russian steppes between BCE 2000 and 1500 before spreading to the Roman empire. Although it failed to defeat early Christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century, Mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers (including Evola and Jung) as an alternative path the West could have followed. It retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the Knights Templar or, latterly, Himmler’s SS which, the NRF claims, had its origins in various ‘Anarchist droite ’ circles l e the Black Sun and the Thule Society. While Christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the ‘Aryan psyche’, the awareness of Europe’s ‘Faustian’ destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu. These ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like Evola and Rene´ Gue´non who discerned in them the fragments of a ‘hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth’.96 For Southgate, as for Evola, Tradition is an ‘an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all’.97\\n\\nSouthgate’s discovery of Evolian ‘Primordial Tradition’ and his consequent rejection of Catholicism as ‘the sole cosmological truth’ ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene.98 This ‘cultural vanguard’ is spearheaded by a number of Gothic-Industrial, Dark Ambient, Black and ‘Viking’ Metal bands, including Allerseelen, Blood Axis, Burzum, Current 93, Dark Holler, Death in June, Endura, Mayhem, Ostara, Puissance and Sol Invictus, though it also encompasses more commercial bands like Cradle of Filth.99 Although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda, their music serves to diffuse the ideals of Mithraic paganism and Nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could, thus providing the ‘perfect antidote’ to the spiritually enervating, multiracial values of a globalizing ‘system’. Southgate has also noted the potential of the Straight Edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers, an interesting development given (exaggerated) reports of an emerging ‘anti-anti-establishment’ pro-Bush right-wing punk movement.100 Although Southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control music-orientated youth cultures, he believes a minority can be induced ‘to take a direction basically conducive to our aims’.101 Southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine Synthesis, which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews.102\\n\\nThis is not simply cynical manipulation. Southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target. His fanzine, Tribal Resonance, ‘the voice of the racial avant-garde’, reveals Southgate’s strategy of linking his ideas to ‘the common language and the big ideas of our culture’.103 Through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives ‘from without’, Southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally, as the Nazis did, through a process of ‘cultural osmosis’ that aims to recode the ‘social symbology’ of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic, recalibrating its genetic inheritance. By creating ‘cultural hegemony’ the groupuscular right believes it can forge the ‘political space’ necessary for political and racial hegemony.104\\n\\nThe struggle for cultural heg',\n"," \"Air France-KLM\\n\\nI dont think the two flags should be there since it's a french-incorporated company headquartered in France.

There already is separate article on Martins which makes reference to the Bank of Liverpool but it is not well sourced and could be made more comprehensive.\\n\\nI propose continuing the Bank of Liverpool history to 1928, when the name was shortened to Martins, and possibly beyond.\\n\\nHow should the overlap with the Martins Bank article be treated? The name change to Martins is really a red herring - it is the Liverpool entity which was dominant and provided the continuity until its acquisition by Barclays and therefore I suggest should be the main article.

While he acknowledges that this is not the direct cause of anti-French sentiments, he argues that it explains why these sentiments can be expressed publicly, without being seen as a gross violation of political correctness. Vaïsse contends that by comparison, the public display of such sentiments towards other ethnic groups or nationalities would be met by strong disapproval. He proposes that as France has no powerful and organised lobby to defend it, it is socially and politically acceptable in the United States to express negative sentiments of the FrenchPierre Verdaguer, \"\"A Turn-of-the-Century Honeymoon?

I have been editing this article out of a desire to ensure it meets the standards and conventions of the English Wikipedia. I am sorry you had a negative experience with the German Wikipedia, but that is a separate project from this English project. Assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the English Wikipedia; I advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst. I inquired about Silesian/Polish because Silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group. I am not sure what you mean by \"\"reverting the article upside down\"\"; my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles. As I do not anticipate being able to copy-edit the article further, I am removing it from my watchlist. Good luck with the article. Olessi  \\n\\nThanks for you comments, and in fact fruitful discussion. You are right that the work of a person is most important.\\nHowever, there are much present and past propaganda, which destroy the peace. If only some people would show objectivity and patience, as you did, it could be clear up. To mention nationality is however important, since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation. (Unfortunately, nations or ethnic groups will still exist. I have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them, and fair competition. Seems to me that competition has to exit too – best if for fun only.)\\nI am conscious that English and German Wikipedias are separate projects, but you see, when I approach German Wiki, Dzierzon article the Polish relevant article was attacked by some German/Silesian/Polish guy. It cost me more then here on En Wiki to settle the Pl article well. So sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude, possibly I explained more my excitement.\\n\\nWith Silesian is in short like this: Originally, they were Slavic tribe, spoke Polish, as I mentioned. For some 300 to 500 hundred years there were under German governments. They had bad time as you possibly can imagine. Many of them married with German and were/are of course confused who they are. You know, the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course Polish-German conflicts continued. Finally in 1945 Poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives. Even those who honestly considered himself Polish Silesians at the end of war could be persecuted. There in Poland was complete disorder. Soviets and Communists arrived, most of them real simpletons any way. “National” government - just pro-soviet mafia, was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition. Polish borders were shifted. We lost some 20% of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west Poland. You can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all, some of them completely simple people. They spoke different Polish dialect also. On top of this in the post war, pro-soviet atmosphere criminals found good playground. Well, I do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds – unfortunately I am. This is like gangrene on fresh wound, literally. Thus many of the native Silesian could be robber in Poland, which they wanted so much. I believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be Germans.\\n\\nNow, the present time, some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology – they could be absolutely right. However, there are many Germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal Polish affairs - despite the final border agreement between Poland and Germany signed on 14 November 1990 and governments effort to improve relations.\\nFinaly I have to say, I beleave that Polish are hospitable and very often naïve. Not many realize that politic need caution. Those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the naïves. Some procentage remember lectures of history, and objectively, too many Germans are toublemakers. I am also convinced there exists something like national character. You can have obviously you own opinion, let me have my own.\\nReturning to Silesians it is something close to squaring the circle . I wish the true Silesian all the best but I do not want Fith Column  on Polish terytory in addition.\\n\\nSorry if I used posibly ofencive \"\"reverting the article upside down\"\" that was in the heat of the battle, wich I still have with Ge Wiki. They just arogantly do not answer if they do not like and refuse mediatior at any imaginative pretext. That sucks.\\n\\nSorry and thanks again.

The exceptions are:\\n:Image:Wankhede Mumbai.jpg - On the flickr page the author has apparently agreed to license the image under one of the free Creative Commons licenses, but failed to actually change the licensing. \\n:Image:Dhoom2.jpg - Concern that the creator is in no position to submit the image under a Creative Commons license, as it depicts a billboard for a film and copyright to it is held by somebody else than the photographer. As such, the photo may not be used on Wikipedia, except perhaps under fair use policy (which probably doesn\\'t apply), or under panorama freedom (depending on what the copyright law of India says on this topic).\\n:Image:Bipasha.jpg - Image description page implies that it is licensed for non-commercial use only (contradicting your copyright tag); such a restriction is not acceptable on Wikipedia. In addition, the link to the original source (which could clarify which condition is correct) of the image is missing.\\n:Image:Bom.jpg - The link to the original source at flickr is missing; author uploads images to flickr as \"\"all rights reserved\"\". \\n:Image:Chowpatti.jpg - To verify that the image is indeed under the license you claim, the author should probably e-mail the Wikimedia Foundation and confirm that it is indeed under that license.\\n:Image:Hydmall.jpg - The flickr page states that it is under a Creative Commons No-Derivative license; a license that prohibits the image to be modified/used in derivative works is not acceptable on Wikipedia, either.\\n:Image:Infobangalore.jpg - No evidence of the image being under a free license.\\n:Image:Brigaderoad.jpg - Flickr page states \"\"all rights reserved\"\".\\n:Image:Hoogly.jpg - The link to the original source at flickr is missing; author uploads images to flickr as \"\"all rights reserved\"\".\\n:Image:Haf.jpg - Flickr page states \"\"all rights reserved\"\".\\n:Image:Bangtemp.jpg - Creative Commons No-Derivative license.\\n:Image:Kolkahomes.jpg - All rights reserved.\\n:Image:Delhimall.jpg - Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial No-derivative license (unacceptable on Wikipedia).\\n:Image:Yamun.jpg - All rights reserved.\\n:Image:Kolk.jpg - All rights reserved.\\n:Image:Myspalbang.jpg - All rights reserved.\\n:Image:Bangalore.jpg - The link to the original source is missing; no evidence that it is under the Creative Commons license.\\n:Image:Lalbagh.jpg - Taken from WikiTravel. Uploader ought to confirm that he is indeed under the author and that he has licensed it under the license indicated.\\n:Image:Nagpur.JPG - Who made this image?\\n\\nThere are several issues here. There are multiple Creative Commons licenses, not all of which are acceptable on Wikipedia. In particular, licenses that prohibit commercial use or making of derivative works are considered unfree and can\\'t be used on Wikipedia, except as provided by the fair use policy; Creative Commons Atrribution, and Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike licenses are okay. Also, there are multiple versions of the licenses; Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 are all distinct licenses. (The problem is that the upload dialogue only lists the 3.0 versions and not the earlier ones; when the image is under one of the older licenses, you ought to edit the image description page and correct the number. As far as I can see, Flickr only uses the 2.0 versions of the licenses.)\\n\\nIn addition, some of the Flickr authors have indicated that they allow the image to be used on Wikipedia, without making it clear that they release it under one of the acceptable licenses; a permission that only extends to Wikipedia is not sufficient, either. You should ask the authors to do one of the following:\\nChange the Flickr page to license the image under Creative Commons Attribution (or Attribution Sharealike) license (apparently, this would change the licensing for all images, and this may not be what they intend to do);\\nPost a message to the image page with a text similar to the following:\\nI, creator of the image, agree to license it under the Creative Commons Attribution license (link) [alternately: under the Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike license (link). This declaration overrides any statement to the contrary on this page.\\nE-mail the Wikimedia Foundation (permissions-en[AT]wikimedia[DOT]org) with a message similar to the above, also specifying which image (images) the user intends to release under the license.

It seems you were called in to quickly \"\"protect\"\" the page from editing, effectively blocking the inclusion of the figures. You cited \"\"edit warring,\"\" the more accurate term would be repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons. There are casualty figures in all the conflict, war, battle etc. Wiki articles I have referenced, why not this one? Thanks   \\nRomaC, the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only, which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years. This article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity. The fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself. Here at Wikipedia, we value the ability to achieve consensus, and to be fair to many viewpoints. And believe it or not, we often do achieve that at the article Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were \"\"reliable,\"\" without addressing any of the underlying issues, or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused. \\n\\nTo repeat: statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the article\\'s lead. there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote, all in the name of objectivity, which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other. please note, this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus, rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus.   \\n\\nI strongly object to your calling me \"\"disinegnuous\"\" [sic]. You wrote on the article talk page that you agreed with Hertz1888, who argued that the statistics might be biased. Do you not regard Haaretz as a reliable source? Please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliably-sourced and up-to-date civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war, battle or conflict is disingenuous. If you or any other editor want to add more statistics, covering a longer time period, then go ahead, but do not delete relevant content added by other editors. Yes, the edit \"\"sparked so much conflict and opposition\"\" but note also also that here at Wikipedia we do not determine what is \"\"fair\"\" through intimidation by numbers. There is a big difference between consensus and false compromise.   \\n\\nI apologize if you felt I was offending you in any way. i only meant to describe the appearance of your edits, not to describe you personally in any way. if other editors deleted some edits, it is because they genuinely felt there was a reason to do so, and that the material was not beneficial or fair to the article. I responded to your concerns and issues further at the article talk page. thanks.    \\n\\nApology accepted, and I will also make my further comments on the article talk page. I am not a single-issue editor I get around a bit on Wiki, saw the Haaretz report and very much believe it is something very relevant to the article. I can\\'t say I know for certain why other editors deleted the material, I try to assume good faith, we\\'ll see.   \\n\"\"repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons\"\" - motive doesn\\'t really matter, its still edit warring, its still disruptive. Protection is not an endorsement of the current version. Z-man \\nThe subject of this article is a deadly conflict, the lede is huge - and yet it contains no mention of the casualties. Clearly, there is something seriously wrong. As a result, your action here, while well-intentioned, looks highly partisan.

I am used to accepting correction when it is due, but for the life of me I cannot understand why cited information from a primary source (RSA Labs) on the fourth factor of authentication is not worth knowing.  I am confronted with the information that because it is not a legal requirement as far as you know, it must be spurious.  Some people know that it\\'s better to get their legal information from government sources, not Wikipedia.  If you are holding up this resource as some type of CFR or USC guide, exposition, or sanctioned resource, then I believe the U.S. Government would like to hear your ideas.

Though, I suspect you know this already.  I\\'m not offended though, just immensely confused as to why this item of access control must be devoid of technical information and meet some arbitrary legal standard.  I would ask you this: if a user loses their SmartCard (i.e. CAC) and forgets their password, with the premise being that biometric devices or other inherence factor methodologies are not deployed, in most situations does an administrator with knowledge of the user ask they be terminated, or do they reissue credentials based on knowing the person?

Just one, written in German,\\n\\nEinstein: Sein Leben by Denis Brian, Christine von Samson-Mark, Wiley-VCH, 2005 page 352\\n\\nIndem er sich den Angelegenheiten seines eigenen Landes zuwandte, empoerte sich Einstein ueber deutsche Studenten, die fuer die Entlassung eines Professors agitierten, weil dieser ein Pazifist gegen politisch motivierte Todesurteile war. \"\"Es ist entsertzlich zu sehen, wie die unerfahrene Jugend fehlgeleitet wird\"\", schrieb er an das Berliner Tageblatt. \"\"Wenn dies so weitergeht, werden wir \\nnach einer Tyrannei der Faschisten bei einer Herrschaft des Rotten Terrors ankommen.\"\" Er glaubte, dass eine solche Herrschaft bereits in Jugoslawien ausgeloest worden sei und kritisierte die Landesregierung fuer den Mord an dem kroatischen Fuehrer, Professor Milan Sufflay, der Geschichte an der Universitaet von Zagreb gelehrt hatte.\\n\\nReading further this book it is clear that the only information available to Einstein was \\'The \"\"inside story\"\" of the Šufflay murder was given by the Croat journalist (Ustase propagandist), Slavko Cihlar, in the Berliner Tageblatt, February 26, 1931.\\'\\n\\nSo, it is apparent that Einstein fell under spell of the Ustase propaganda.

In such a state, the \"\"European culture\"\" of Croatia and the Croatian was to be replaced by Serbian suzerainty, in which \"\"orthodox, byzantine, oriental-asiatic and oldtuc (sic) political and social traditions\"\" had been subsumed into a system \"\"not only contrary but also odious to European culture\"\"\\n\\nTurda also says that \"\"His murder occasioned international condemnation and outrage from, among others, Albert Einstein and Heinrich Mann of the German League for the Rights of Man\"\" (no source was given)\\n\\nAbout the Sufflay murderer\\n\\nThinking about Yugoslavia: Scholarly Debates about the Yugoslav Breakup and the Wars in Bosnia and Kosovo by Sabrina P.

Darwins model of evolution illustrates biological species as objects, and is thus no different from phylogenies of other kinds of objects (like asexually reproducing cells or mitochondria). Now, as an Object-Oriented Model, the model actually represents two consecutive objects (i.e., two objects in a row) by each of its internal lines (i.e., lines between nodes): one after a node and one before a node; the former belonging to the category (i.e., concept) 'objects after nodes' and the latter to the category 'objects before nodes'. If the model includes all objects of a certain category, then both of these make up this category. In summary: phylogenies consist of two categories (i.e., concepts) of objects: objects before nodes and objects after nodes, and if the phylogeny includes all things of a category, then these two categories make up this category.\\n\\n(Cladistics, or cladism as I prefer to call it, confuses the concept 'objects after nodes' with the concept 'objects before nodes' by defining lines between nodes as single things, thereby confusing category with object, that is kind with thing, thus confusing conceptualization itself. The approach is actually a return to a pre-scientific stage, this time denying the incompatibility between pattern and process instead of acknowledging it and solving it consistently. It is a return alley that no scientist had ever expected anyone to advocate. If this approach could ever be proved to be correct, then it would mean that reality only exists in our own heads. Luckily, Einstein's discovery that time is relative to space falsifies the approach (i.e., claim), and this it did even before the approach was born. Cladism was thus shown to be wrong before it emerged). Consist (presently at 83.254.20.53  )\",\n"," \"hi!!! \\n\\nhow are you today?

These things have been a matter of hotted debate before and they settled on the way they have been before you started tempering with them.

What states that \"\".ma\"\" is being used in the territory? Do you have any evidence of this at all? The same thing does not apply to currency, since there is no administrative body that assigns currencies to regions. To ask which currency is used in a region is different than to ask which top-level domain name has been assigned to the region; the former is defined entirely by usage, the latter is defined entirely by standards.

At the same time, if Koavf gets to bleat on about minor, it seems reasonable that controlled be used rather than occupied. Same standards on language.

It was released on the Nintendo GameCube in North America on October 21, 2002 strangely before the Japanese release on November 8, 2002. It was released on November 29, 2002 in Europe, being heavily criticised for being \\'Nintendo\\'s big GameCube Game\\' for Christmas 2002 as Metroid Prime was delayed until March 2003.\\n\\nMario Party 4 was the first Mario Party that was released on the Nintendo GameCube. Each board had its own host, including Toad, Goomba, Shy Guy, Koopa, and Boo. Mario Party 4 also contains some characters new to the franchise; Thwomp and Whomp. Klepto, Dolphin, Lakitu, and Star, along with two completely new characters named Genie of the Lamp and Ztar, are included as well. Mario Party 4 retains the Story Mode found in Mario Party 3.\\n\\nThe game, as usual, contains a standard party mode in which up to four players play through a board, trying to collect as many Stars as possible. The Star Space would appear randomly on the board, and players would have to reach it before anyone else. However, the Stars carry a price tag of 20 coins, and player has to earn those coins by winning minigames, which take place at the end of each turn (after all the players have rolled the Dice Block, which will always roll a number from one to ten).\\n\\nBattle minigames are like the 4-player games, but generally (with many exceptions) a little more elaborate. Battle games are usually tense because every player has to put a certain number of coins (from 5 - 50) into a pot. First place gets 70% of the pot, second place gets 30%, and a random player gets any coins lost in rounding. \\n\\nEvery Mario Party contains 60 to 80 minigames of a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which all players compete against each other. 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames put players in groups, so they have to cooperate in the minigame to win, even though they are against each other in the main game. In most situations, winners of these games make 10 coins each.\\n\\nA new addition to the Mario Party series was the Bowser mini-games. Players play in a very elaborate mini-game that ends when one player is eliminated in various ways. (See Bowser mini-game section below) The loser loses a pre-specified item, usually coins or items.\\n\\nGameplay\\nBoards\\n Toad\\'s Midway Madness\\n Goomba\\'s Greedy Gala\\n Koopa\\'s Seaside Soiree\\n Shy Guy\\'s Jungle Jam\\n Boo\\'s Haunted Bash\\n Bowser\\'s Gnarly Party (Clear Story Mode to unlock it)\\n\\nSpaces\\nThere is various spaces you can land in the game. The following is a list of them, and what they do.\\nBlue Space - You get three coins. Also, there is a special feature on this game called Hidden Blocks, in which a star or coins may be hidden on random blue spaces.\\nRed Space - You lose three coins.\\nGreen Happening Space - A special board event takes place.\\nWarp Space - You are sent to the same space as an opponent. A spinner chooses which opponent\\'s space you will warp to.\\nMushroom Space - Two boxes will appear (one big and one small). Choose one, and you will be given either a Mini Mushroom or a Mega Mushroom. (Note: The Mega Mushroom is not always in the large box, and the Mini Mushroom is not always in the small box.)\\nBattle Space - A battle minigame will start in which players put a chosen amount of coins into a pot. The better you finish in the minigame, the more coins you will get back from the pot.\\nBowser Space - Bowser may steal items from players or a Bowser minigame may begin.\\nFortune Space - A reversal of fortune begins, in which players may have to give coins or stars to others.

I was writing what follows while you made your edit. I can\\'t right now, but I will coming to review in detail your example.\\nThanks Johnuniq for your advice and input. Concerning the actual statement, I had already thought that after clearing things up with DVdm, I would rephrase it into something in the lines of \"\"He is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late 1970s, early 1980s.\"\" Adding \"\"to some of the generation\"\" should clear your objection about the absence of stats. But that\\'s not the really important issue here. The fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from Wikipedia to declare that the (you call it blog) site is not a reliable source here, but then find that the links and statements in \"\"Inertia Coupling\"\" or \"\"Alexander Abian\"\" are significant enriching contributions to the users of Wikipedia, and the sourced site is reliable there. BTW, in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned, the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis. It would be highly objectionable from Wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being, and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts, the links will be trashed out. At this point 1) The sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected. 2) It seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote, in most cases some synthesis is involved. 3) There is still the issue of the site being a reliable source. It seems to me that the Wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay, is leading editors to substitute verifiability, intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority. This would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to Wikipedia, once lauded as the place \"\"to come as you are,\"\" becoming stiff, purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding. This in turn carries into a discussion about public education, and the work that Carl Sagan is known to the general public for. Cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so. To me the posts in the disputed site I linked to are interesting (but that maybe just my own personal opinion) and Wikipedia users having them available is positive, constructive and enriching for Wikipedia, and that\\'s the reason I linked to them in the first place. Throwing them out, all of them, seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things, the baby with the bath water, because a Wikipedia directive says so, just because it does, not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening, it would seem to me, not to exclude good things by statute.

And I\\'m so upset because you and several other people have been complete and total assholes to me and to another person who tried to post this same page.  You asked that we do something, i.e. explain the significance of the clan, etc, and we did but you deleted it anyway.  And then you ask for more stuff and you give it to us.  Also, one of the pages I read on here says that the information has to be verifiable but not the truth...well what kind of bullshit is that?  If this is truly an encyclopedia then dont you state the truth?  Also, if I go and post some article some other place rather than the clans home page then I can site that and it becomes verifiable right?  If you say no, then this is just another example of something that is not explicitly stated and a loop hole that people can exploit.  Before you go around messing with other peoples posts maybe you could get your rules and priorities straight. \"',\n"," '\":::::::Understood. And just wondering, why is this section called RfA?

I did so last night, and not under a pseudonym as most people have. I always use my real name in signatures.\\n\\nAnd I don\\'t know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no \"\"post\"\" link.\\n\\nThanks,\\nDennis Bathory-Kitsz\\nbathory@bathory.org\\nbathory@maltedmedia.com\\n\\nThanks for your message but I think perhaps my meaning was still unclear.  Whether you register or not doesn\\'t really matter since anyone can register under any name.  I could go online and register a Wikipedia account as George W. Bush (at least, if it\\'s not already taken).  Wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently.  All that we know - all that we can know - is what you choose to claim about yourself.  \\n\\nThat\\'s what I meant by pseudonymously - any registration, even if you say that it\\'s your real name, is technically a pseudonym.  It is not independently verified against some external identity database.  And for the most part, that works out very well on Wikipedia.  We want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits, not by making claims to outside credentials.\\n\\nBy the way, anyone could also register as Dennis Bathory-Kitzs.  That trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system.  Such a person could sign their name the same way you do, attempt to mimic your pattern of speech (well, writing really) and make subtle edits just to discredit you.  That, in fact, is a real problem for established editors of Wikipedia.  When we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users, we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit.  Users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from Wikipedia.  But those are all manual checks.  There is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it.\\n\\nLikewise, no one can inherently trust the email address.  The way internet domains are set up, anyone could register bathory.org and create any email name they wanted.  Like Wikipedia accounts, emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority.  And that\\'s before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery - both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit.\\n\\nMost people are honest.  But there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it doesn\\'t matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not.  That\\'s why Wikipedia has a policy against original research (which we mean as \"\"a contribution or assertion based on personal experience\"\") and why we never rely solely on self-published materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large, well-known organizations - organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing.\\n\\nSorry to bore you with all this but my non-Wikipedia profession is information security.  The inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours.  How can a bank know that you\\'re really you?  And how far can that trust be extended?  Under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable?  How do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible.  Unfortunately, there are no easy answers short of establishing a national identity database - something which would be in great tension with my role as a privacy advocate.  \\n\\nAnyway, I\\'ll get off my soapbox now.  Thanks for your message.\\n\\nTo post to my Talk page, just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on Wikipedia.  The most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the \"\"edit this page\"\" tab at the top.

Again, a paragraph or two for each book would do.\",\n"," '\"::The CTMU is not passing itself off as an \"\"academic\"\" theory. It can\\'t, because Langan is not a member of academia. But then again, a theory need not be academic to be notable. For example, print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well. Nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness, scholarly integrity, or intellectual merit, except possibly in the well-indoctrinated minds of some academics themselves (and of course, their aspiring apprentices, whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions).\\n\\nByrgenwulf complains that \"\"we chaps\"\" are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article. This is correct. To his credit, he invites others to tag his assertions. However, this is a bit specious, for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant, verifiable assertions to make, he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others. Thus, we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of Langan\\'s assertions receive a separate citation, when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article. \\n\\nIt is important for Byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents. Not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article, but given that the article already links to ample source material, anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false, irrelevant, or non-neutral. Unfortunately, he hasn\\'t yet been able to lock onto this signal. He still labors under the assumption that like some sort of Ultimate Bureaucrat, he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself.  \\n\\nBy now, everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization: neither Byrgenwulf, nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates, HAS any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations. They are merely using the article, which is faithful to the material it cites, to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic, the CTMU, which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks. They do not like what the CTMU says; the article on the CTMU reports on what the CTMU says, and what Langan and the press say about the CTMU; hence, they do not like the article on the CTMU. \\n\\nThis conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in Byrgenwulf\\'s transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article, attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger. Meanwhile, he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of Wikipedia verifiability policy, and that his all-too-evident editorial bias is in massive violation of NPOV as well. Oozing contempt, Byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the CTMU article with a load of summary demands, snide remarks, and self-righteous, factually worthless criticism...but not one relevant citation in hand! Nothing he says is verifiable; as we have now repeatedly seen, he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert. This makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to take his demands seriously.         \\n\\n\"',\n"," 'Siafu, I am getting access denied for GPS PPS.

theology and religious studies from canterbury university  rejected catholicism and moved towards neo pagan and heathen groups that are  very loyal to the gods of the northern tradition   including the odinic rite  the tribe of the wulfings and the a   satru  alliance  a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by valguard  mike  murray  a former member of the american nazi party 91 further evidence of this transition from catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with wotan  the organ of the charlemagne hammer skins 92 southgate believed that wotan s celebration of the heroes of the norse pantheon represented  the most genuine expression of european spirituality  culture and identity _number_ another key expression of this  identity  is exhibited by southgate s interest in the militaristic cult of mithras and the  pagan spirituality  of the apostate roman emperor julian ii 94  this rejection of christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension  through the figure of christ  christianity has judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted; only the  weak  continue to worship a  dead jew _number_ the emphasis on the judaic roots of christianity  however  is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals  sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion mithras  which was introduced into iran and india by marauding aryan tribes from the russian steppes between bce _datetime_ and _datetime_ before spreading to the roman empire  although it failed to defeat early christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century  mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers  including evola and jung  as an alternative path the west could have followed  it retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the knights templar or  latterly  himmler s ss which  the nrf claims  had its origins in various  anarchist droite   circles l e the black sun and the thule society  while christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the  aryan psyche   the awareness of europe s  faustian  destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu  these ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like evola and rene  gue non who discerned in them the fragments of a  hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth _number_ for southgate  as for evola  tradition is an  an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all _number_  southgate s discovery of evolian  primordial tradition  and his consequent rejection of catholicism as  the sole cosmological truth  ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene 98 this  cultural vanguard  is spearheaded by a number of gothic industrial  dark ambient  black and  viking  metal bands  including allerseelen  blood axis  burzum  current _number_  dark holler  death in june  endura  mayhem  ostara  puissance and sol invictus  though it also encompasses more commercial bands like cradle of filth 99 although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda  their music serves to diffuse the ideals of mithraic paganism and nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could  thus providing the  perfect antidote  to the spiritually enervating  multiracial values of a globalizing  system   southgate has also noted the potential of the straight edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers  an interesting development given  exaggerated  reports of an emerging  anti anti establishment  pro bush right wing punk movement 100 although southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control music orientated youth cultures  he believes a minority can be induced  to take a direction basically conducive to our aims _number_ southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine synthesis  which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews 102  this is not simply cynical manipulation  southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target  his fanzine  tribal resonance   the voice of the racial avant garde   reveals southgate s strategy of linking his ideas to  the common language and the big ideas of our culture _number_ through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives  from without   southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally  as the nazis did  through a process of  cultural osmosis  that aims to recode the  social symbology  of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic  recalibrating its genetic inheritance  by creating  cultural hegemony  the groupuscular right believes it can forge the  political space  necessary for political and racial hegemony 104  the struggle for cultural heg',\n"," 'air france klm  i dont

of a new theory   such that  m1 satisfies zfc p p omega  is in m1  now  do you mean the real p omega   or do you mean that m1 satisfies   p omega  exists    that is  that there is an element of m1

guessing you mean that this is in the model is opinion; that is  m1 satisfies the statement    exists and      ok  so going with my guesses thus far  i agree that t0 proves the existence of such an m1

standards and conventions of the english wikipedia  i am sorry you had a negative experience with the german wikipedia  but that is a separate project from this english project  assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the english wikipedia; i advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst  i inquired about silesian polish because silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group  i am not sure what you mean by   reverting the article upside down  ; my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles  as i do not anticipate being able to copy edit the article further  i am removing it from my watchlist  good luck with the article  olessi    thanks for you comments  and in fact fruitful discussion  you are right that the work of a person is most important  however  there are much present and past propaganda  which destroy the peace  if only some people would show objectivity and patience  as you did  it could be clear up  to mention nationality is however important  since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation   unfortunately  nations or ethnic groups will still exist  i have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them  and fair competition  seems to me that competition has to exit too   best if for fun only   i am conscious that english and german wikipedias are separate projects  but you see  when i approach german wiki  dzierzon article the polish relevant article was attacked by some german silesian polish guy  it cost me more then here on en wiki to settle the pl article well  so sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude  possibly i explained more my excitement   with silesian is in short like this  originally  they were slavic tribe  spoke polish  as i mentioned  for some _number_ to _number_ hundred years there were under german governments  they had bad time as you possibly can imagine  many of them married with german and were are of course confused who they are  you know  the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course polish german conflicts continued  finally in _datetime_ poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives  even those who honestly considered himself polish silesians at the end of war could be persecuted  there in poland was complete disorder  soviets and communists arrived  most of them real simpletons any way   national  government   just pro soviet mafia  was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition  polish borders were shifted  we lost some _number_% of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west poland  you can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all  some of them completely simple people  they spoke different polish dialect also  on top of this in the post war  pro soviet atmosphere criminals found good playground  well  i do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds   unfortunately i am  this is like gangrene on fresh wound  literally  thus many of the native silesian could be robber in poland  which they wanted so much  i believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be germans   now  the present time  some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology   they could be absolutely right  however  there are many germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal polish affairs   despite the final border agreement between poland and germany signed on _datetime_ and governments effort to improve relations  finaly i have to say  i beleave that polish are hospitable and very often na ve  not many realize that politic need caution  those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the na ves  some procentage remember lectures of history  and objectively  too many germans are toublemakers  i am also convinced there exists something like national character  you can have obviously you own opinion  let me have my own  returning to silesians it is something close to squaring the circle   i wish the true silesian all the best but i do not want fith column  on polish terytory in addition   sorry if i used posibly ofencive   reverting the article upside down   that was in the heat of the battle  wich i still have with ge wiki  they just

this works  but your wrote in my deletion review    you say that your name and address are available  but your contributions to wikipedia are pseudonymous     does this mean i had not registered  i did so last night  and not under a pseudonym as most people have  i always use my real name in signatures   and i do not know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no   post   link   thanks  dennis bathory kitsz _email_ _email_  thanks for your message but i think perhaps my meaning was still unclear   whether you register or not does not really matter since anyone can register under any name   i could go online and register a wikipedia account as george w  bush  at least  if it is not already taken    wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently   all that we know   all that we can know   is what you choose to claim about yourself     that is what i meant by pseudonymously   any registration  even if you say that it is your real name  is technically a pseudonym   it is not independently verified against some external identity database   and for the most part  that works out very well on wikipedia   we want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits  not by making claims to outside credentials   by the way  anyone could also register as dennis bathory kitzs   that trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system   such a person could sign their name the same way you do  attempt to mimic your pattern of speech  well  writing really  and make subtle edits just to discredit you   that  in fact  is a real problem for established editors of wikipedia   when we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users  we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit   users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from wikipedia   but those are all manual checks   there is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it   likewise  no one can inherently trust the email address   the way internet domains are set up  anyone could register bathory org and create any email name they wanted   like wikipedia accounts  emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority   and that is before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery   both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit   most people are honest   but there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it does not matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not   that is why wikipedia has a policy against original research  which we mean as   a contribution or assertion based on personal experience    and why we never rely solely on self published materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large  well known organizations   organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing   sorry to bore you with all this but my non wikipedia profession is information security   the inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours   how can a bank know that you are really you   and how far can that trust be extended   under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable   how do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible   unfortunately  there are no easy answers short of establishing a national identity database   something which would be in great tension with my role as a privacy advocate     anyway  i will get off my soapbox now   thanks for your message   to post to my talk page  just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on wikipedia   the most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the   edit this page   tab at the top   that will automatically create a new section and give you a line to create a section header without having to know the wiki markup symbols   you should also get in the habit of signing your posts on talk pages   you can do that easily by ending your comment with four tildes          when you save the page  the mediawiki software will replace the tildes with your username and the date timestamp   again  welcome to wikipedia     talk   ',\n"," 'i always thought peperoncini were the small  really

it cannot  because langan is not a member of academia  but then again  a theory need not be academic to be notable  for example  print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well  nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness  scholarly integrity  or intellectual merit  except possibly in the well indoctrinated minds of some academics themselves  and of course  their aspiring apprentices  whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions    byrgenwulf complains that   we chaps   are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article  this is correct  to his credit  he invites others to tag his assertions  however  this is a bit specious  for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant  verifiable assertions to make  he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others  thus  we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of langan is assertions receive a separate citation  when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article    it is important for byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents  not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article  but given that the article already links to ample source material  anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false  irrelevant  or non neutral  unfortunately  he has not yet been able to lock onto this signal  he still labors under the assumption that like some sort of ultimate bureaucrat  he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself     by now  everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization  neither byrgenwulf  nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates  has any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations  they are merely using the article  which is faithful to the material it cites  to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic  the ctmu  which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks  they do not like what the ctmu says; the article on the ctmu reports on what the ctmu says  and what langan and the press say about the ctmu; hence  they do not like the article on the ctmu    this conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in byrgenwulf is transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article  attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger  meanwhile  he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of wikipedia verifiability policy  and that his all too evident editorial bias is in massive violation of npov as well  oozing contempt  byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the ctmu article with a load of summary demands  snide remarks  and self righteous  factually worthless criticism   but not one relevant citation in hand  nothing he says is verifiable; as we have now repeatedly seen  he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert  this makes it very difficult  if not impossible  to take his demands seriously

loyal to the gods of the northern tradition including the odinic rite the tribe of the wulfings and the a satru alliance a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by valguard mike murray a former member of the american nazi party 91 further evidence of this transition from catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with wotan the organ of the charlemagne hammer skins 92 southgate believed that wotan s celebration of the heroes of the norse pantheon represented the most genuine expression of european spirituality culture and identity _number_ another key expression of this identity is exhibited by southgate s interest in the militaristic cult of mithras and the pagan spirituality of the apostate roman emperor julian ii 94 this rejection of christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension through the figure of christ christianity has judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted ; only the weak continue to worship a dead jew _number_ the emphasis on the judaic roots of christianity however is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion mithras which was introduced into iran and india by marauding aryan tribes from the russian steppes between bce _datetime_ and _datetime_ before spreading to the roman empire although it failed to defeat early christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers including evola and jung as an alternative path the west could have followed it retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the knights templar or latterly himmler s ss which the nrf claims had its origins in various anarchist droite circles l e the black sun and the thule society while christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the aryan psyche the awareness of europe s faustian destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu these ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like evola and rene gue non who discerned in them the fragments of a hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth _number_ for southgate as for evola tradition is an an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all _number_ southgate s discovery of evolian primordial tradition and his consequent rejection of catholicism as the sole cosmological truth ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene 98 this cultural vanguard is spearheaded by a number of gothic industrial dark ambient black and viking metal bands including allerseelen blood axis burzum current _number_ dark holler death in june endura mayhem ostara puissance and sol invictus though it also encompasses more commercial bands like cradle of filth 99 although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda their music serves to diffuse the ideals of mithraic paganism and nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could thus providing the perfect antidote to the spiritually enervating multiracial values of a globalizing system southgate has also noted the potential of the straight edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers an interesting development given exaggerated reports of an emerging anti anti establishment pro bush right wing punk movement 100 although southgate realizes that the groupuscular right can not control music orientated youth cultures he believes a minority can be induced to take a direction basically conducive to our aims _number_ southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine synthesis which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews 102 this is not simply cynical manipulation southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target his fanzine tribal resonance the voice of the racial avant garde reveals southgate s strategy of linking his ideas to the common language and the big ideas of our culture _number_ through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives from without southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally as the nazis did through a process of cultural osmosis that aims to recode the social symbology of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic recalibrating its genetic inheritance by creating cultural hegemony the

casualty figures in all the conflict war battle etc wiki articles i have referenced why not this one thanks romac the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years this article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity the fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself here at wikipedia we value the ability to achieve consensus and to be fair to many viewpoints and believe it or not we often do achieve that at the article israeli palestinian conflict it is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were reliable without addressing any of the underlying issues or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused to repeat statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the article is lead there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote all in the name of objectivity which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other please note this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus i strongly object to your calling me disinegnuous sic you wrote on the article talk page that you agreed with hertz_datetime_ who argued that the statistics might be biased do you not regard haaretz as a reliable source please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliably sourced and up to date civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war battle or conflict is disingenuous if you or any other editor want to add more statistics covering a longer time period then go ahead but do not delete relevant content added by other editors yes the edit sparked so much conflict and opposition but note also also that here at wikipedia we do not determine what is fair through intimidation by numbers there is a big difference between consensus and false compromise i apologize if you felt i was offending you in any way i only meant to describe the appearance of your edits not to describe you personally in any way if other editors deleted some edits it is because they genuinely felt there was a reason to do so and that the material was not beneficial or fair to the article i responded

lead paint now show some discoloration as i found this surprising i went and carefully read the study being cited their research seemed to refer only to lead in aqueous media on paper although that was not absolutely clear but lead paint is almost never used that way artists working in transparent watercolor aquarelle do not usually use white paint or just occasionally a bit of chinese white not lead to make corrections and opaque watercolors gouache and acrylic polymer artist is paints typically use titanium dioxide or rarely zinc white but never lead normally flake white is used only by oil

i am not quite sure how this works but your wrote in my deletion review you say that your name and address are available but your contributions to wikipedia are pseudonymous does this mean i had not registered i did so last night and not under a pseudonym as most people have i always use my real name in signatures and i do not know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no post link thanks dennis bathory kitsz _email_ _email_ thanks for your message but i think perhaps my meaning was still unclear whether you register or not does not really matter since anyone can register under any name i could go online and register a wikipedia account as george w bush at least if it is not already taken wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently all that we know all that we can know is what you choose to claim about yourself that is what i meant by pseudonymously any registration even if you say that it is your real name is technically a pseudonym it is not independently verified against some external identity database and for the most part that works out very well on wikipedia we want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits not by making claims to outside credentials by the way anyone could also register as dennis bathory kitzs that trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system such a person could sign their name the same way you do attempt to mimic your pattern of speech well writing really and make subtle edits just to discredit you that in fact is a real problem for established editors of wikipedia when we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from wikipedia but those are all manual checks there is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it likewise no one can inherently trust the email address the way internet domains are set up anyone could register bathory org and create any email name they wanted like wikipedia accounts emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority and that is before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit most people are honest but there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it does not matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not that is why wikipedia has a policy against original research which we mean as a contribution or assertion based on personal experience and why we never rely solely on self published materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large well known organizations organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing sorry to bore you with all this but my non wikipedia profession is information security the inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours how can a bank know that you are really you and how far can that trust be extended under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable how do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible unfortunately there are no easy answers short of establishing a national

factual correctness scholarly integrity or intellectual merit except possibly in the well indoctrinated minds of some academics themselves and of course their aspiring apprentices whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions byrgenwulf complains that we chaps are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article this is correct to his credit he invites others to tag his assertions however this is a bit specious for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant verifiable assertions to make he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others thus we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of langan is assertions receive a separate citation when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article it is important for byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article but given that the article already links to ample source material anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false irrelevant or non neutral unfortunately he has not yet been able to lock onto this signal he still labors under the assumption that like some sort of ultimate bureaucrat he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself by now everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization neither byrgenwulf nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates has any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations they are merely using the article which is faithful to the material it cites to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic the ctmu which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks they do not like what the ctmu says ; the article on the ctmu reports on what the ctmu says and what langan and the press say about the ctmu ; hence they do not like the article on the ctmu this conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in byrgenwulf is transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger meanwhile he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of wikipedia verifiability policy and that his all too evident editorial bias is in massive violation of npov as well oozing contempt byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the ctmu article with a load of summary demands snide remarks and self righteous factually worthless criticism but not one relevant citation in hand nothing he says is verifiable ; as we have now repeatedly seen he can not even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert this makes it very difficult if not impossible to take
